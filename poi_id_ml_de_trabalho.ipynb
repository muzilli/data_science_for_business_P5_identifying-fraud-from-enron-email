    "## by Rafael Tomaz, Identify Fraud from Enron Email\n",
    "\n",
    "Em 2000, Enron era uma das maiores empresas dos Estados Unidos. Já em 2002, ela colapsou e quebrou devido a uma fraude que envolveu grande parte da corporação. Resultando em uma investigação federal, muitos dados que são normalmente confidenciais, se tornaram públicos, incluindo dezenas de milhares de e-mails e detalhes financeiros para os executivos dos mais altos níveis da empresa. Neste projeto, você irá bancar o detetive, e colocar suas habilidades na construção de um modelo preditivo que visará determinar se um funcionário é ou não um funcionário de interesse (POI). Um funcionário de interesse é um funcionário que participou do escândalo da empresa Enron. Para te auxiliar neste trabalho de detetive, nós combinamos os dados financeiros e sobre e-mails dos funcionários investigados neste caso de fraude, o que significa que eles foram indiciados, fecharam acordos com o governo, ou testemunharam em troca de imunidade no processo."
